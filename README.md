A project on implementing a simple version of the C standard library function called Printf.
This implementation can only handle only the c, s, %, i and d format specifiers.
The main function used buffering, in conjunction with switch cases to determine the appropriate action to to take based on a format specifier.
5 files are needed with to run this function, master_func contains the main function, int_handler to handle d or i specifiers, clean_bufmem to print contents of buffer, charwrit to print a character using write and main.h as a header file.
The function was solely created by myself, Botshelo Xolile Banda.
